# Client Activities 🛠️

This is an internal tool intended to be used for the automated parsing of CSV data pertaining to client activities which contain time data for each task. The tool will calculate the due date for each activity and neatly display the information for internal teams to utilise for planning purposes. Due dates are calculated based on the duration of the activity and the start date. Due dates can only fall on business days during business hours.
